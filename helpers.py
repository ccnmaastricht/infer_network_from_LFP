def postsynaptic_potential_to_current(C_m, tau_m, tau_syn):
    r""" Computes a factor to convert postsynaptic potentials to currents.

    The time course of the postsynaptic potential ``v`` is computed as
    :math: `v(t)=(i*h)(t)`
    with the exponential postsynaptic current
    :math:`i(t)=J\mathrm{e}^{-t/\tau_\mathrm{syn}}\Theta (t)`,
    the voltage impulse response
    :math:`h(t)=\frac{1}{\tau_\mathrm{m}}\mathrm{e}^{-t/\tau_\mathrm{m}}\Theta (t)`,
    and
    :math:`\Theta(t)=1` if :math:`t\geq 0` and zero otherwise.

    The ``PSP`` is considered as the maximum of ``v``, i.e., it is
    computed by setting the derivative of ``v(t)`` to zero.
    The expression for the time point at which ``v`` reaches its maximum
    can be found in Eq. 5 of [1]_.

    The amplitude of the postsynaptic current ``J`` corresponds to the
    synaptic weight ``PSC``.
